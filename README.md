# Python Practice Task

This repository contains Python programs that I have practiced as a BCA student. 
It includes exercises related to user input, calculating the GCD of numbers, summing numbers from 1 to n, generating squares of numbers, and working with Python data structures like 
strings, tuples, and dictionaries. 
All code is written and tested using Google Colab as part of my learning journey in programming and data analytics.
Feel free to explore the notebooks and files in this repository!
